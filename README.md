# EmploYou
This is a project for an assignment by TU Gabrovo. It functions as a central hub for graduates searching for job opportunities. It establishes a link between firms and students. The main idea is that all graduates get access to this platform, where they can find "Trails" made by the firms. If they have an interest in the offer, the students join the trail and participate in the internal training conducted by the company. When they finish the trail, all students go through an exam, where all successful students get an interview.     The application itself is a desktop Java application with a UI assembled with JavaFX. It uses MariaDB for a database and connects to it using the MariaDB ODBC driver. Users can be classified as Admin, Students, Teachers, Employees, or Diamond Employees. Each role has different capabilities, for example: Employers can create trails, the admin can configure and manipulate data, and users are only able to participate in trails and read public information.
